# Brownian-Particle-Escape-Problem
Investigating Random Walk and Escape of Brownian Particles 

This is a research project runs MonteCarlo Simulation to investigate Brownian Particle's behaviors on an Euclidean plan.
The modle has the flexibility to adapt different algorithms for particle's movement, starting point, 
to improve the simulation efficiency.
Movement regions (even three dimensional surfaces) and  boundaries can also be tweaked to explore more generic/random 
Escape problems.
